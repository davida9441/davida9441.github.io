## Flag of Greece by david agudo

## Describe your program

-  The country I designed for is Greece
-   I expect a 2 or a 3 because i haven't completely finished my flag yet. I am almost done though. The teacher has also helped me. 


## Current output

## Describe your process.

I asked questions to the teacher while doing this project. The teacher has helped me with questions such as "how do i make stripes?". The teacher has really helped me because he showed me what to put in my code and the code worked. Some of the challenges I faced were how to code the stripes. It was really hard to figure out what numbers to put. I overcame this challenge by asking the teacher for help, and he did help me. 


## Explain your code.

* * *

```
base1 = place-image(stripe, width / 2, 7.5 * stripe-height, base)

base2 = place-image(stripe, width / 2, 5.5 * stripe-height, base1)

base3 = place-image(stripe, width / 1.2, 3.5 * stripe-height, base2)

base4 = place-image(stripe, width / 1.2, 1.5 * stripe-height, base3)

```

* * *


 
The base means the line. Place-image means to put the image that was defined. stripe means a long narrow band or strip, typically of the same width throughout its length, differing in color or texture from the surface on either side of it. width means the measurement or extent of something from side to side. the numbers mean how wide or tall i want the stripe to be. then stripe-height means the heignt of the stripe, how tall it is. base1, base2, base3 means that I am putting the previous code into the next one so there will be more stripes in the flag.
