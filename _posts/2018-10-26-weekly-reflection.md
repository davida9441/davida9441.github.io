This week in AP CSP, we began with an intro to data science. We learned about header, and data rows.We did answered questions by choosing either categorical, which means "which one?", or quantitative, which means "how many?". After that we did Accessing Values from Tables. For example, we did shapes = table: name, corners

row: "triangle", 3
row: "square", 4

shapes=object, row-n = name, (0) = arguments. 

We also did Making Connections. call/apply, contract, domain, range, function, define, data, and structure go with Reactive systems. Arguments, categorical, quantitative, data row, header, table go with data science. Markup, HTML, CSS, web, hyperlink, and tag go with Internet.
