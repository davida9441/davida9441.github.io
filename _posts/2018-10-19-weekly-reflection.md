This week in AP CSP, was pretty smooth. We coded flags of the world. I think it was easy because we had to do the diferent codes to make different shapes. We got to choose what flag we wanted to do. The flag that I chose was the Japan flag and it was easier than the other flags because all I had to do was put a red circle in a white rectangle. What we learned this week was coding flags, and I did the japan flag. What I did to code the flag was:

BC = circle( 25, "solid", "red")
