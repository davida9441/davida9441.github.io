This week in AP CSP, we started with an Intro to Structures. We learned about DeliveryState, which names a new type. delivery names a function that creates delivery states. A point is two #'s held together. Then, we used examples to solve problems. For example, is a birthday-cake taller than a red-velvet cake?

fun taller-than(cake -1, cake -2)
end

# for example is birthday taller than velvet

check:

taller-than(birthday-cake, red-velvet-cake)

is true

My biggest struggle was getting the programs to work. Sometimes i type in things, and it says that identifier is unbound, it is used, but not previously defined. Im still trying to figure out how to run a program without getting that error message. Maybe i have to go back to the definitions area and double check my work. Then i will not have any problems. Even 1 mistake in the definitions will make an error in the program. This means that coding is very delicate and takes everything literally.
