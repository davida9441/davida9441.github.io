I feel good about this class because we are learning more about coding. This year we are learning more advanced coding. I also feel like it is difficult and that coding is delicate because machines can take things literally. I feel overall that this class is going to get harder as the year goes by. It is easy too because the teacher makes us do things step by step and it makes work a lot easier. 

We are learning how to code in AP CS class. We are working with Github and are working on our learning blogs. What I learned is that HTML is the structure of page and content. CSS is the style of page, font color, color background. Web browser is a specific software application for rendering web pages. Markup languages describe the content and the structure of a document. Some examples of markup languages are HTML, Markdown, and LaTex. 

My biggest struggle in this class is that I dont know where to put things when I code. Sometimes there are things in coding that I don't understand.
