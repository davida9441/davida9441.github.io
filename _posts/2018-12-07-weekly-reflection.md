This week in AP CSP, we did flags. We chose our flags from fotw.info, where we were assigned flags. We got to choose from 2 different flags of 2 different levels. I chose the Greek flag for the practitioner level. The questions i have is what do the colors of the flag represent in Greece? Do the colors mean anything? When was the flag first created?

The challenges I faced during the project was the ratios and proportions. I had to find a precise measurement on my paper for 2:3. To overcome that challenge, i did the flag 4 inches in height and 6 inches in width, which is 2:3. The other challanges I faced was measurement, it was really hard to do exactly 4 inches in height and 6 inches in width, i had to be very precise in my measurement. I also had trouble with the colors because the some of the colors of my flag were not available. To overcome that challange, I got creative and used different colors instead. Overall, I enjoyed this project and what I would do differently is to measure first and figure out the proportions.
